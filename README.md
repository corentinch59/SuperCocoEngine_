## Welcome to the Super Coco Engine !


This is a very simple 2D game engine made in C++ using the `SDL2` lib.   
### Demo in distrib
The demo game is played with a controller    
-> Left stick to move   
-> left and right trigger to rotate the sword   
The demo is about slashing monsters that spawns near the player
